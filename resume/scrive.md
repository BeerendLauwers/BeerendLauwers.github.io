title: Cover Letter of Beerend Lauwers for the position of Haskell Backend Developer at Scrive
---


*This cover letter was created with Hakyll from a Markdown document. [You can view it online here](http://beerendlauwers.be/resume/scrive.html).*

Dear Sir or Madam,

As a nice person stuffed with skills that are related to the position of Haskell Backend Developer advertised in Reddit's [/r/haskell](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/4p3s00/haskell_developer_position_at_scrive/) on 21 June, I would like to explain why I am an excellent match for this position.

I was first introduced to Haskell during my studies in Computing Science at Utrecht University.
Enamoured, I enrolled in as many courses that touched upon functional programming as possible, getting my first hands-on programming experience with Haskell.

Of course, small class exercises can only get you that far.
So, [for my Master Thesis](http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/294073), I implemented a [3000+ line code contract inference system](https://github.com/beerendlauwers/school/tree/master/master-thesis).
This solidified my desire to use Haskell in a professional setting - it is absolutely up to the task.

After finishing school, I kept up with the Haskell ecosystem, seeing the birth of Stackage, Stack, Servant, Turtle and many other influential libraries and systems up close, as well as witnessing the soaring popularity of lenses, shake, Haskell-to-JavaScript compilers and honest-to-god Haskell IDEs.

I personally took a keen interest in [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), a static site generator, and have [written a few articles](http://beerendlauwers.be/) [^blog-note] on Hakyll's internals.
I maintain a [`hakyll-extra`](https://github.com/beerendlauwers/hakyll-extra) package that contains useful functionality for Hakyll-based sites. [^hakyll-extra-extra]

Hakyll was also used to author a few web applications at my current occupation at Capgemini Belgium.
[Here is an example](http://afschakelplan.eandis.be/).

Within Capgemini Belgium, I mainly do Drupal development, working on large enterprise websites with a distributed (=Indian and Belgian) team.
I also act as the knowledge manager of the global Capgemini Drupal community, ensuring that newly-gained insights are shared internationally.

As a consultant, I also handle client communication, organizing requirement meetings, demos and feedback moments.

For the majority of the clients, I worked remotely for one or two days per week, staying connected with my teammates via Slack, Trello, JIRA and Confluence.
In several projects, I handled both front-end (HTML5, JavaScript, SASS, Bootstrap) and back-end development (PHP [^php], bash scripting).

At Capgemini Belgium, people come to me for two reasons:

1. They have some weird critical issue that no one else has been able to resolve.
2. They need someone to write documentation. [^aaaand]

I *love* writing documentation.
Particularly *useful* documentation that helps the reader to understand and learn.
This means I gravitate towards knowledge sharing efforts within my work environment and eagerly contribute. [^hakyll-project]

I am also a devops afficinado.
Together with a colleague, I carved out a CI system that runs Selenium tests on BrowserStack along with a bunch of linters on all of our code, and I have my own server rack in the basement that I am in the process of configuring to teach myself Puppet, Chef, Kubernetes, Ansible, Halcyon and whatever else framework they can think of next [^framework].

I have some working experience with Docker, but Windows does *not* make that easy.
Speaking of which, I do have Linux experience as well and am eager to join the holy war between `emacs` and `vim` [^holy-war].

I am confident that my skill set [^beer] will be an excellent addition to your company.
Feel free to call me at 0032 491 35 79 64 (cell) or to e-mail me at [beerendlauwers@gmail.com](mailto:beerendlauwers@gmail.com?subject=Your%20application%20for%20Haskell%20Backend%20Developer%20at%20Scrive) to arrange an interview.

Sincerely,

Beerend Lauwers

[^blog-note]: Which is *also* generated [using Hakyll](https://github.com/beerendlauwers/beerendlauwers.github.io/tree/code).
[^hakyll-extra-extra]: I'm going to put it on Hackage, I *swear*. I just need to clean up the `.cabal` file a little more...
[^php]: I pushed my teammates to try [Hack](http://hacklang.org/), but that didn't catch on.
[^aaaand]: *...aaand* if I owe them lunch money. Not that that would come up in this position a lot.
[^hakyll-project]: *In fact*, I have something very interesting underway that will help the Haskell community with their knowledge management immensely. Feel free to invite me to an interview if you want to know more ;).
[^framework]: There's another framework that uses a Haskell-based DSL to parse configurations, but I can't remember the name. It used classical music  terms a lot. Aaaanyway, back to the cover letter you go.
[^holy-war]: and `nano`.<sup>Please don't burn me.</sup>
[^beer]: Not to mention my sets of Belgian beers that will make their way to the bi-yearly conferences.
