<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.afaspersonal.nl">AFAS Personal</a> is a simple financial management tool. Its main features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to export your financial data from your online banking site into the tool via a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/afas-personal-bijwerk-ass/fhdjnejhhklnclpkbnfmfimijnlmghfk?hl=nl">browser extension</a></li>
<li>Supports several banks</li>
<li>Automatic tagging of transactions by searching for similar transactions and through (user-definable) tagging rules</li>
<li>Ability to add one or more labels to a transaction</li>
<li>Ability to add attachments to a transaction</li>
<li>Splitting up a transaction into two transactions</li>
<li>Update or remove a transaction</li>
<li>Revert a transaction to its original, imported state</li>
<li>Budget overview with fancy charts to indicate what goes where on an per-account basis (or for all accounts)</li>
<li>Overview of running contracts and automatic generation of letters of request for service cancellation</li>
<li>Pay slip management</li>
<li>Pension calculation (NL only)</li>
<li>Multiple-access</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea here is to recreate a subset of the aforementioned functionality, with the ability to extend it later on with more features. Finally, have it run on a VM / Docker instance (or just on your local machine).</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-learn">What you will learn</h2>
<p>A lot, actually. This would take you through the entire cycle of thinking about program structure, development, testing / debugging and deployment.</p>
<h3 id="things-you-will-encounter">Things you will encounter:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Parsing: It might be that your bank exports your data to a CSV file or a custom file format, in which case you’ll have to learn about parsing / parsing combinators.</li>
<li>Working out program architecture: For example, think about what the type of a function that splits up a transaction could look like. Perhaps something like <code>Transaction -&gt; [Transaction]</code>? Hmm, we’ll need some more info…</li>
<li>Passing data to the browser and the UI: Lots of opportunity here to learn about <a href="https://github.com/faylang/fay/wiki">Fay</a>, <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, <a href="http://haste-lang.org/">Haste</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs">ghcjs</a> or <code>aeson</code> + your favourite JS templating framework.</li>
<li>FRP: Perhaps you’d like it all to be reactive? Perhaps work it out without FRP first and then refactor it as a lesson in refactoring?</li>
<li>Authentication and security: you’ll want to take best practices into account here.</li>
<li>Web frameworks / libraries: Perhaps you can do some of the heavy lifting in processing transactions on a Haskell server.</li>
<li>Databases: Perhaps you’ll have the client do everything and just use the server as a persistent store.</li>
<li>Saving functions: But what about the tagging rules? Perhaps simply write out the function to a file and save it to the persistent store, hot-loading it later? Or perhaps a simple embedded DSL that allows people to piece together new filter functions from existing (default and custom!) ones? Crowd-sourced filter functions, anyone?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can always throw more stuff into the mix. Want to use <code>lens</code> in an actual project? Go for it! Want to create a simple data store that can be queried via a web API generated with <code>servant</code> and write the program logic in another language entirely? No problem.</p>
<h2 id="rough-implementation-guide">Rough implementation guide</h2>
<p>Because this is a very broad project, the suggested steps are <em>very</em> rough.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You’ll probably want to be able to get your transaction data from your bank first. This might involve a lot of hoops or the use of a browser extension to do it reliably.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, you’ll want to be able to parse that raw data into a Haskell data structure to do stuff with it.</p></li>
<li>From here on out, you’re on your own. Some high-level design decisions for you to contemplate:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Will I have the client do most of the calculations and just treat the server as a simple data store, or will the server do more stuff? Perhaps both and cross-compile with GHCJS?</li>
<li>Perhaps all data could be downloaded to client available for offline viewing.</li>
<li>How will I handle the UI?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bonus-features">Bonus features</h2>
<ul>
<li>A transaction can only be placed in a single category. Why not more than one? A transaction could easily be a vacation expense and a dinner expense.</li>
<li>Add an audit log that identifies the changes that were done (updating/splitting up a transaction,etc). Perhaps add the ability to roll back to a previous changeset? This opens up the fun idea of keeping your data in a git repository.</li>
<li>Virtual accounts: based on <em>something</em> (originating account number, name, category, transaction note, etc), a transaction is placed in a virtual account.</li>
<li><p>Perhaps something like <code>type VirtualAccount = [Source]</code>, where <code>Source</code> is a list of filters on all transactions. For example,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">fortisFilter <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">AccountFilter</span> (<span class="dt">Fortis</span> <span class="st">&quot;0012020333&quot;</span>)
source <span class="fu">=</span> [fortisFilter]</code></pre></div></li>
<li>Make all data queryable via a(n) (secured) API.</li>
<li>Make all data exportable to Excel / CSV / JSON / an SQL OLAP cube.</li>
<li><p>Make it possible to import a data dump from AFAS Personal ;)</p></li>
</ul>
