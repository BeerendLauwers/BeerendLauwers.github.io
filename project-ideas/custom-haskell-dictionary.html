Simple, Web, Chrome Extension

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>Learning Haskell can be very hard for both experienced programmers and novices because of a lot of new lingo. What’s a functor? A monad? What do they mean by “mapping over” a data structure?</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be nice if, on Haskell-related websites, such terms were automatically tagged with a tooltip that appears when you hover over it (or click it)? The tooltip itself could just refer to some newbie-friendly tutorial or wiki page.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-learn">What you will learn</h2>
<p>This one is pretty devoid of Haskell programming. You’ll learn to create a Chrome extension and will have to write some JavaScript (although you could use <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> or <a href="http://www.purescript.org/">PureScript</a> instead.)</p>
<h2 id="rough-implementation-guide">Rough implementation guide</h2>
<h3 id="chrome-extension">Chrome extension</h3>
<p>There’s already an existing Chrome extension that does something similar: <a href="https://github.com/max99x/dict-lookup-chrome-ext">Dictionary Lookup for Chrome</a>. Apart from the Chrome extension, that Github repo has an entire Wiki-scraping parser that is irrelevant.</p>
<p>It might also be worthwhile (and interesting!) to simply write your own Chrome extension.</p>
<h4 id="bonus-features">Bonus features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Bonus points if it also includes a whitelist of sites on which the extension should run.</li>
<li>Extra bonus points if the user is able to permanently dismiss a tooltip with an “I got the concept, thanks” button.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-source">Data source</h3>
<p>For development purposes, a simple hardcoded JSON array would suffice. For the live dictionary, there are a lot of options, but my simplest idea would be to have a Github repository that hosts a JSON file. This would allow people to submit push requests to update the JSON file with new or updated entries.</p>
<h4 id="bonus-features-1">Bonus features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps having several JSON files, each with a specific flavour (category theory, type theory, etc) would be nice to have as well. The extension user could then opt in to several dictionaries via a user interface.</li>
</ul>
