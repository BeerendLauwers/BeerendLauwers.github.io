<h2 id="what">What</h2>
<p><a href="http://payment-services.ingenico.com/gb/en/online-payment-services-solutions/e-commerce/online-payments">Ogone</a> is a payment processing system popular in the Netherlands and Belgium.</p>
<p><a href="https://secure.ogone.com/ncol/Ogone_e-Com-ADV_EN.pdf">A comprehensive implementation guide is available here</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is to be able to construct a data structure with all the necessary attributes to send a payment request to the Ogone payment processing system. Expect lots of <code>data</code> declarations and <code>newtype</code>s, but also some simple business logic (generating a SHA from all attributes, etc).</p>
<p>Once implemented, you can try it out yourself with a Haskell web framework. Test accounts for Ogone are free, although they take a day or two to be approved.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-learn">What you will learn</h2>
<p>This project will make you think on how to structure a program with types.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For example, the Ogone payment system expects a number of required attributes, and a number of optional attributes. What could you do to ensure that the required attributes are <em>always</em> filled in? Perhaps by using <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Smart_constructors">smart constructors</a>. Or maybe some requirement checks can be made type errors.</p></li>
<li><p>In the end, a POST request is sent to the payment processing system with all of the attributes included. How can we prevent invalid attribute names being generated?</p></li>
<li>Once processed, a payment can be in three different states:
<ul>
<li>Paid: payment was successful.</li>
<li>Not paid: payment was declined.</li>
<li>Uncertain: the request to the acquirer timed out, and will be tried at a later time to not keep the customer waiting.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Ogone is able to send a HTTP request to the originating website when one of these states is reached. Accepting and parsing these requests is a good exercise to get acquainted with Haskell web frameworks such as <a href="https://github.com/scotty-web/scotty">Scotty</a>, <a href="http://snapframework.com/">Snap</a> and <a href="http://www.yesodweb.com/">Yesod</a>.</p>
<p>You can also test out the rest of the functionality on a simple Haskell web framework. Bonus points if you include some kind of form redirect generation functionality.</p>
