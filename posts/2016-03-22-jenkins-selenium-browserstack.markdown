title: Using Selenium IDE to generate TestNG tests and run them on BrowserStack via a Jenkins Maven job
---

It's amazing how little professional documentation there is available for Selenium integration, especially Selenium IDE.

I'm going to assume that you already have experience with Selenium IDE, TestNG, BrowserStack and Jenkins.

## Selenium IDE: Generate TestNG tests

### What is it

Selenium IDE is a Firefox plugin. There's also [Selenium Builder](https://github.com/SeleniumBuilder/se-builder), which will probably be used in the future.
I'm still using Selenium IDE for the moment.

### Generating TestNG test files

Open up Selenium IDE in Firefox and do the following: 

<div class="image small">
![Exporting to TestNG with Selenium IDE](/images/selenium/testng.png)
</div>

## TestNG

### What is it

TestNG is a Java-based test framework.
It seemed a pretty sensible one, so I just picked it.

## Maven 

### What is it

Maven is a build manager for Java projects.
Jenkins has built-in support for Maven jobs, and it's less complex than an Ant script.

## Creating a Java project and rigging it up with TestNG tests

[This blog post](http://www.guru99.com/maven-jenkins-with-selenium-complete-tutorial.html) explains it quite well, so follow that first.

If it's down, here's a mirror: [Mirror](/images/selenium/Maven & Jenkins with Selenium_ Complete Tutorial.html).

### Interfacing with BrowserStack

The files generated by Selenium IDE assume a local Selenium instance, but we want to test with BrowserStack.

In each test, you'll want to add the following import statements:

```Java
import java.net.URL;
import org.openqa.selenium.remote.DesiredCapabilities;
import org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver;
```

In the `setUp()` method, you will want to replace the lines

```Java
driver = new FirefoxDriver();
baseUrl = "YOUR_URL";
```

with

```Java
DesiredCapabilities capability = new DesiredCapabilities();
capability.setPlatform(Platform.WINDOWS);
capability.setCapability("build", "TestNG - Sample");
driver = new RemoteWebDriver(
  new URL("http://BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME:BROWSERSTACK_PASSWORD@hub.browserstack.com/wd/hub"),
  capability
);

baseUrl = "YOUR_URL";
```

In the runner method (usually named the same as your class), you'll want to add 

```Java
driver.get(baseUrl);
```

in the appropriate location (at the start, after any `String` declarations).

## Setting up a Maven project with the TestNG project

The [aforementioned blog post](http://www.guru99.com/maven-jenkins-with-selenium-complete-tutorial.html) also covers this.


## Done!

Really, the only special bit here is that we're now running everything via BrowserStack.
BrowerStack currently doesn't have a complete tutorial for proper Jenkins integration, so I thought I'd write this down to get a starting document going.
